<br>Final Product: A website to help students conquer procrastination.</br>
<br>This is a user experience research project by giving a prototype as a solution to a problem. We spent four months on it. At the beginning,
we chose our field would be study which meant we need to make a digital product to help students study better. We spent more than
one month for observation and interviews. Then we had several group meetings to figure out the most common but important problem of 
our subjects - procrastination. It gave us some trouble to find it cause almost all students mentioned it inadvertently during
the interview. After settling on the problem, we started to prototype. Each of us made a prototype with Axure, a wireframe tool to
make an App or a website, and we conducted user test for all prototypes. With comparision and combination, we used one prototype as 
the base and modified the user flow.</br>
